# Prepaid Program Design Document

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to outline the design of a prepaid program system. The system will allow users to load funds onto a prepaid account and use those funds for various transactions.

## System Architecture
The system will be composed of the following components:
- **User Interface**: A web or mobile application for users to interact with the prepaid program.
- **Backend API**: A RESTful API to handle all business logic and data processing.
- **Database**: A relational database to store user information, transaction history, and account balances.

## Main Components and Interactions
1. **User Interface**:
   - Registration and login
   - Load funds onto the prepaid account
   - View account balance and transaction history
   - Make transactions using the prepaid account

2. **Backend API**:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Account management (create, update, delete)
   - Transaction processing (load funds, make transactions)
   - Reporting (generate transaction history, account statements)

3. **Database**:
   - Users table: Stores user information (ID, name, email, password, etc.)
   - Accounts table: Stores account information (ID, user_id, balance, etc.)
   - Transactions table: Stores transaction history (ID, account_id, amount, type, date, etc.)

## Data Model
The data model will include the following tables:

### Users Table
| Column   | Type    | Description           |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|
| id       | INT     | Primary key           |
| name     | VARCHAR | User's name           |
| email    | VARCHAR | User's email          |
| password | VARCHAR | User's password (hashed) |

### Accounts Table
| Column   | Type    | Description           |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|
| id       | INT     | Primary key           |
| user_id  | INT     | Foreign key to Users  |
| balance  | DECIMAL | Account balance       |

### Transactions Table
| Column      | Type    | Description           |
|-------------|---------|-----------------------|
| id          | INT     | Primary key           |
| account_id  | INT     | Foreign key to Accounts |
| amount      | DECIMAL | Transaction amount    |
| type        | VARCHAR | Transaction type (load, spend) |
| date        | DATETIME| Transaction date      |

## API Endpoints
The following API endpoints will be provided:

### User Endpoints
- `POST /api/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /api/login`: User login

### Account Endpoints
- `GET /api/account`: Get account details
- `POST /api/account/load`: Load funds onto the account
- `GET /api/account/transactions`: Get transaction history

### Transaction Endpoints
- `POST /api/transaction`: Make a transaction

## Additional Considerations
- Security: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and secure.
- Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of users and transactions.
- Performance: Optimize the system for fast response times and efficient resource usage.
